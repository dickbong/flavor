 CHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nominal unified China is feeble and divided. While Japanes threatening the northern border and an immient war seems inevitable, the internal war has shown no sign of ending and keeps tearing the country apart. Seeking help from both USSR and the Reich, China's stance will not only tip off the balance of the existing world order but also its own future. \n\nHowever, 4 hundred million Chinese people had never given up and never will. China is at a crossroad and wherever it leads, China will not perish without a fight and will seek its rightful position in the world."

 employ_western_officers_desc:0 "The hundred year of struggle has taught us that we can't win a war by merely quantity. Even though we have nearly one million soldiers, they are poorly trained and supplied. It is urgent to learn from the western at the moment."
 continue_sino_german_cooperation_desc:0 "Germany was defeated in the Great War, however its military genius didn't get wiped out. The development of Zhongzheng Rifle is a great success under the Sino-German Cooperation and we should extend our cooperation for even more."
 ussr_support_desc:0 "Red Army has been growing up fast ever since its establishment and their development of equipment and tanks is surely something we can learn from. We had a cooperation in 1920s but that one didn't end up in betrayal and blood. However at this moment, even at the risk of importing communism, we need their help to defend ourselves against the Japanese invaders."
 democratic_armory_desc:0 "Traders from democratic countries are fair, they don't care about your cause as long as you pay. Since several staffs of our government has connections with the US and British government, maybe we can get a fair deal from them."
 extend_terms_desc:0 "The Sino-German cooperation was a success, but like all good things, it has to come to an end. However if we sent out a proposal of extending the terms, they may accept. Meanwhile we have to offer something they would find hard to reject - a reliable and strong ally in Asia."
 restablish_united_front_desc:0 "Ever since regaining the support from USSR, our officers and soldiers have learned a lot. However Stalin insist that our leader have to negotiate a peace with communist rebels if we want them to continue supporting us.

 arms_trade_desc:0 "The arms trade with democratic countries grants us access to world best weaponry and technology. However, they didn't come without a political purpose as we expected.

 independent_development_desc:0 "The help of Westerns boosted our development, however it's the time for the coopertaion to come to an end.

 tsingtao_cooperation_company_desc:0 "To deepen our cooperation, German experts suggested us to found a official cooperation company in their old colony - Tsingtao, so we can work without harassment from Japan's military presence.

 nanchang_mineral_company_desc:0 "Soviet experts always has the best sense of smell for the resource.

 xiamen_trade_company_desc:0 "Western merchants are suggesting that we found a government own company in Hainan for even wider international trade. And they are also willing to invest for dock and factory construction for bigger cargo capacity.

 chengdu_industry_bureau_desc:0 "After the withdrawn of all the foreign experts and millitary staffs, our military and industry are suffering a chaotic transformation.

Our engineers are already studying their shared blueprints."
 whampoa_rifle_desc:0 "Since now we have no technology support from foregin engineers, we have to develop new weaponry on our own. It may be wise for us to start with small equipments such as rifles. Our engineers have already gathered in Whampoa to deign the new standard rifle for the NRA."
 blueshirt_coup_desc:0 "The cooperation with Germans has taught us fascism is the right path for a modern state. The old Kuomingtang is too weak and indecisive to rule the repulic.

 revolutionize_kuomingtang_desc:0 "Our commissars has already infiltrated every factory, mine and port. Comrades from Yan'an have agreed to accept our leadership once we take control of the government and Soviet also promised that they will let us into the family of comintern. It's the time to revolutionize the corrupted and outworn Kuomingtang and establish a government from the people and for the people."
 democratic_election_desc:0 "The repulic was never a republic, it was controlled by one party and one dictator. Recently, the imported western technology not only taught us how to fight but also taught us how to think. To build a strong nation, we have to give our people the right to vote and to speak. A national party congress should be held now to discuss about the future of China!"

Otherwis it's only a matter of time till it falls into the wrong hands."
 found_yat-sen_research_institute_desc:0 "The success of Whampoa Rifle let us realize what can our talents can achieve if they work together towards one unified purpose.
